# ATM
I made an ATM project where user can manage bank account with java loops
The user logs in with the user name and password that he has previously registered in this program.
Then you will see 4 different options (deposit, withdraw, balance inquiry and exit)
If he enters the username or password incorrectly 3 times the account is blocked and the system shuts down
